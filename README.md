# Juce_VST_Projects

So I made all these from youtube tutorials, 

following TheAudioProgrammer & then a fellow named Reon Fourie who did the distortion plugin.

The API had switched around some and TheAudioProgrammer uses a mac and xCode 
so it was a little difficult to follow along but I got it in the end.

Same with Reon's there was a bit of a conversion issue with the plugin editor I think, 
if you followed the tutorials and did a comparison of mine vs their's you'd find
the differences pretty quick.

My next plans are to try and get a synth going that has all the basic features.
Seems to be more difficult than I thought initially but we will get there eventually! :D


I spose a how to on how to run the files, the .sln and visual studio files were really huge.

I only uploaded the source and juce project as well as the VST3  files so you could use them and see if they run on your machine.

If you download the latest version of juce, you should be able to just make a folder with the project name, 
or just make a new project, add the source files to the source folder. Should be able to compile off the bat but I haven't actually tried it myself.
