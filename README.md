# Juce_VST_Projects

So I made all these from youtube tutorials, 

following TheAudioProgrammer & then a fellow named Reon Fourie who did the distortion plugin.

The API had switched around some and TheAudioProgrammer uses a mac and xCode 
so it was a little difficult to follow along but I got it in the end.

Same with Reon's there was a bit of a conversion issue with the plugin editor I think, 
if you followed the tutorials and did a comparison of mine vs their's you'd find
the differences pretty quick.

My next plans are to try and get a synth going that has all the basic features.
Seems to be more difficult than I thought initially but we will get there eventually! :D
